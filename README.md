# Calculator-In-Python-By_Huzaifa785

Hi Pythoneers ! This is Huzaifa Mohammed and in this repo, I've made a simple calculator with the the help of python. This calculator can add, subtratct, multiply and divide the numbers. Also it can give you the square rot, the value of sin, the value of cos, value of tan and value of log too. I've used the tkinter library for creating this GUI. I know that I am not very much perfect so if you think that there can be some improvements in this project, I request you to please make the changes and create a pull request, I'll surely merge it.
